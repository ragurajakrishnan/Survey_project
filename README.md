
# Survey Management System

## Overview
This is a Django-based web application for creating, managing, and taking surveys. 
It supports two user roles:
- **Creators**: Can create, publish, and manage surveys.
- **Takers**: Can take available surveys and view survey completion details.

## Features
- **Survey Creation**: Add questions with multiple-choice options.
- **Survey Management**: Publish, close, or edit surveys.
- **Dashboard**: Separate dashboards for creators and takers.
- **Survey Responses**: View aggregated results for closed surveys.
- **User Authentication**: Registration, login, and role-based access control.

## Project Structure
- `db.sqlite3`: Database file for storing application data.
- `manage.py`: Django's command-line utility for administrative tasks.
- `survey_app/`: Contains the core functionality of the application.
    - `models.py`: Database models for surveys, questions, options, and responses.
    - `views.py`: Handles the application logic for different pages.
    - `templates/survey_app/`: HTML templates for user interfaces.
    - `static/survey_app/`: Static files (CSS, JS, images).
- `survey_project/`: Project configuration directory.
    - `settings.py`: Configuration settings for the Django project.
    - `urls.py`: URL routing for the application.
